                In this website quickbooks uses Visual Hierarchy in order to demonstrate where the priority of 
                elements is on the page. First you see the bannor with their slogan then you see the try it free. After there is 
                the things around that where it gives you more information. Finally at the bottom there is a screen shot of what the 
                website looks like when you are using it.

            <p>
                For the quickbooks website they use Repetition. As the user scrolls down the page there are a sequence of features
                that this program offers that are shown. During this it uses the set template of the marketing pitch being
                put above the link to the relative page. This lets the user know how they are supposed to interact with the information.

                Discord uses alot of whitespace in their design, but this isnt because they dont have anything to show. 
                In their website the vector images use the whitespace as a canvas in order to make it feel like it is part of the image. 
                this makes the site have an open and airy feel while not looking like it is sparcely populated with information. It also 
                has a good color contrast in the images.
