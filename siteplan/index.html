        <h3>Site Purpose:</h3>
        <p>This site is designed as a showcase for my photography 
            content and as a place to contact me. The site needs to lay 
            out the different services that I provide. These will be laid 
            out with different price options. There needs to be a contact 
            page where there is a way to email me and a link to my different 
            socials. There also needs to be a page that allows me to sort 
            and showcase all of the different work that I have done in the 
            past. There needs to be two stages for the pictures, stage one is 
            having them as a grid or flex view, the other needs to let the user 
            click on one and blow it up to higher quality. There will be a left menu 
            with all of the different albums that I can drop the pictures into.
